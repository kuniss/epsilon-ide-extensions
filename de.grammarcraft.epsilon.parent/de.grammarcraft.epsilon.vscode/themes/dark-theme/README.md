This is the dark theme for the [Epsilon EAG language extension](https://link).

It provides a special syntax coloring for Extended Affix Grammars to clearly differentiat between the meta and the hyper parts of the grammar.

This theme makes especially sense if the Epsilon EAG language extension is installed and an Epsilon EAG grammar specification is loaded.

The theme is originated from Visual Studio Code Dark+ theme and extended for scopes provided by the Epsilon EAG language extension for Epsilon grammar specifications.
